As an average Chinese student seeking for development in English, I consider myself lucky for having sessions with him. Not only did he correct my pronunciation errors, he also delivered me with spectacular insights in writing. The patience and devotion he has shown is also well appreciated. In spite of all that, he broadens my horizon to a new perspective to English and makes my eyes wide open to a new world. I do appreciate his hard work and thanks to him.',
